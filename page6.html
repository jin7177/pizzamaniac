The traditional margherita is topped with nothing but tomato sauce (uncooked, simple), mozzarella (traditionally fresh), and basil. A bit of olive oil after baking is also pretty typical.<br><br>

Higher on the hydration scale, with oil added to the dough for extra tenderness and crunch. Baked in a pan, usually with oil in the bottom in varying quantities (depending on how calorie-conscious you might be), the crust will usually be quite crispy on the outside, being almost fried. Inside should be fairly 'open' though, with plenty of air/bubbles giving it a texture much lighter than its appearance would suggest at first. Cheese is originally brick cheese, but it does lend itself well to experimentation. Try mozzarella and some monterey jack for starters. The sauce generally goes on top of everything else in strips. Baked at a lower temperature to ensure the middle is fully cooked, in the 250-275C range for 20-30 minutes depending on how thick everything is.<br><br>

This can be rectangular like a Detroit style, but there's also nothing wrong with making it round. It's got a fluffy, spongy bread base into which is incorporated olive oil. It's generally of a lower hydration level than its detroit brethren. It's also baked in a well-oiled pan. On top you will find a cooked, meatless sauce made of tomatoes, onions, and various herbs. <br><br>

One of it's tell-tale characteristics is it can be folded in the center in half to eat. Typically topped fairly simply, with just cheese or cheese and pepperoni. That's not to say you can't go a little crazy with the toppings though. These are usually baked in the 300-350C range for 8-15 minutes. The dough may or may not include sugar and oil, depending on what kind of flavour and texture the creator is after.<br><br>

                    <td valign = top class = "pizinfotxt">This is the penultimate 'deep-dish' pizza. It's got a more pie-like crust, due to its much lower hydration and much higher oil/fat content (in the vicinity of 10-20% or sometimes even higher!). It's layered with loads of cheese, vegetables, meat, and then the sauce all goes on top. This one will take quite a long time to bake, so the sauce on top will serve to protect the more vulnerable ingredients from drying out. The crust can be 4cm or even higher and is also baked in a pan with oil in the bottom so it gets that frying effect and comes out quite crispy at the end. For this you're looking at a baking temperature of 200-250C and a baking time of 25-30 minutes or as long as it takes to make sure everything is well cooked!<br><br>

                    <td valign = top class = "pizinfotxt">Classicly, it's got a thin crust which is quite low in hydration. This gives it a much more crispy, sometimes almost crackery, crust. You can do the pizza bianca (white) or the pizza rossa (red). Generally the dough will be rolled out as opposed to hand shaping to make sure it's as flat as possible while pushing out any possible bubbles that could potentially burn while baking. It won't take long in the oven though since it's so thin, so don't overtop! For this you can go for 350-400C and it shouldn't take more than a couple of minutes to be finished.<br><br>

                    <td valign = top class = "pizinfotxt">That's right. Put away your cups and teaspoons and all that nonsense. Time to pull out the scale! Now, it's going to be useful to have 2 different scales here. One for the heavier ingredients (flour/water) but also one for the ingredients that you need to be a little bit more accurate with. This means mostly the yeast, and, to a lesser excent, salt and sugar/oil (if you intend to include those). So for this, we're talking about a scale that can measure to 0.1g, 0.01g, or, if you're really looking to get crazy, 0.001g. Baker's percentages base everything off the quantity of flour, which is 100%. So if you have 60% water, and you have 100g of flour, you will be using 60g of water. Thus a recipe with 200g of flour 100% flour, 60% water, 2% salt, and 0.5% yeast will work out to be.... you guessed it - 200g flour, 120g water, 4g salt, and 1g of yeast.<br><br>
